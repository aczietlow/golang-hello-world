# TODO list

  * Webcrawler
    * Build a **BASIC** web crawler
      * Stop getting distracted by actually making a working web crawler
    * Refactor the crawler to support concurrency
  * The dining philosopher problem

## Web Crawler

Currently, working in the `fundamentals/concurrency/examples/webCrawler` directory.

* Pick back up from the miro board as a design of what I was thinking for concurrency
  * Not having access to maps or slices due to being unsafe and causing race conditions is going to be a challenge for future Chris to figure out
* Look more into: https://jdanger.com/build-a-web-crawler-in-go.html
